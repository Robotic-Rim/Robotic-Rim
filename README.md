## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi anyone who reads this! My name is Ivan and this is my GitHub. I created it to keep my progress in the exciting world of statistics, machine-learning and AI.

My current goal is to create and work on several project to 'show off' my skills. Though I am at the beginning of my journey but as someone once said: "A journey of 1000 kilometers (yes! I use metric system) starts with just one step!"

I will update this README as I progress further in my journey.

Have a nice day,
Ivan
